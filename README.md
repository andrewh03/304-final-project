# Analysis on 2019 Canadian Federal Election: What would be different if everyone had voted?
This repo is dedicated for the analysis of the 2019 Canadian federal election results. I use Multi-Regression Post-Stratification technique to build a model on the available survey data and use the population census data to construct demographic cells and find the estimates for each cell.

The study is built upon two data sets:

Survey data 
Census data

Sections included in this repo:

R Script: contain all the relevant cleaning code and the code for reproducing our ourput pdf.
Output: contain the output pdf for the report and the cleaned datasets.
Reference.bib: contain the necessary references.
